Please be very mindful and strictly adhere to proper scenario writing when creating feature files.

ðŸ‘‰ Use "The user" instead of "I" in all steps, and ensure there are no extra spaces.

ðŸ‘‰ Keep pulling the latest changes from core regularly. When merging, please ensure that other files are not altered or deleted â€” be extra careful and vigilant about this.

ðŸ‘‰ IMPORTANT: Do not modify existing methods in the step definitions, as this may break existing test cases. If you need to reuse an existing method, simply add your required annotations without changing the current ones.
